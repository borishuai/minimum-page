Minimum Page comes from a frustration with CSS resets and bases. Ripping down the styling only to rebuild many of the same styles is unnecessary, especially for defaults common to all browsers.

Minimum page is brought to you by Peter Wilson and Josh Kinal at [Soupgiant](http://soupgiant.com), we blog at [Big Red Tin](http://bigredtin.com) or you can follow [Peter](http://twitter.com/pwcc/) and [Josh](http://twitter.com/sealfur) on Twitter.

## LESS Version
A [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) version is in the process of being built, including a number of mixins for use once it is time to build your site. A base will continue to be available as a normal CSS file.

You can see the progress on the [less-version](https://github.com/soupgiant/minimum-page/tree/less-version) branch.
